## SEO included out of the box

- Unique `<title>` and `<meta description>` per page
- Canonical URLs on every page
- Open Graph + Twitter card meta on every page
- Schema.org JSON-LD: `Plumber` (LocalBusiness) on home, `BreadcrumbList` on inner pages, `FAQPage` on home
- Semantic HTML, accessible nav, skip-link, alt text where used
- `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`
- Fast: no external JS frameworks, single CSS file, system font stack

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. **Create a repo** (e.g. `postlewhite-plumbing-site`) and push these files to the `main` branch.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, set:
   - Source: `Deploy from a branch`
   - Branch: `main` / root (`/`)
3. The included `CNAME` file points the site at `www.postlewhiteplumbing.co.uk`. Once Pages is live, configure DNS at your registrar:
   - **CNAME** record on `www` → `<your-username>.github.io`
   - **A** records on the apex (`@`) pointing to the four GitHub Pages IPs:
     - `185.199.108.153`
     - `185.199.109.153`
     - `185.199.110.153`
     - `185.199.111.153`
4. Back in GitHub Pages settings, tick **Enforce HTTPS** once the SSL cert provisions (can take an hour).

## Things to update before publishing

The site uses real details pulled from the public Facebook page where available. A few items to verify or replace:

- **Gas Safe Register number** — currently shown as "Gas Safe Registered Engineer" without a number. Add the actual number to the home page hero card and footer if you want it displayed publicly.
- **Opening hours** — defaults are Mon–Fri 8–6, Sat 9–2, Sunday emergency only. Adjust in the page footers, the home hero card, the contact page, and the `openingHoursSpecification` JSON-LD on `index.html`.
- **Reviews** — three placeholder reviews on the home page, marked with HTML comments `PLACEHOLDER REVIEW`. Replace with real Facebook reviews (with the customer's permission) or remove the section.
- **Email** — currently `possplumboffice@gmail.com` (the Facebook page email). If you set up `info@postlewhiteplumbing.co.uk`, do a project-wide find/replace.
- **OG image** — `assets/img/og-image.svg` is a generated placeholder. Replace with a 1200×630 PNG photo (`assets/img/og-image.png`) and update the `<meta property="og:image">` tags if you want a real photo in social shares.
- **Favicon PNG** — only an SVG favicon is included. Add `apple-touch-icon.png` (180×180) to `assets/img/` for iOS bookmarks.

## Editing tips

- **Phone, email, WhatsApp** appear in the header CTA, hero card, every footer, and the sticky mobile call bar. To change, find/replace `07902 025580`, `+447902025580`, `possplumboffice@gmail.com` across the project.
- **Add a new service area** — copy a card in `areas.html`, add a tag in `index.html` and a link in the footer if it's a major town.
- **Add a new service** — copy one of the `<article id="…" class="service-block">` sections in `services.html`, then add a card to the home page services grid.

## Local preview

The site is plain static HTML — open `index.html` in a browser, or run any static server:

```bash
# Python
python -m http.server 8080

# Node
npx http-server -p 8080
```

## Browser support

Modern evergreen browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). No build step, no JS framework, no tracking. The CSS uses CSS variables and grid, both supported everywhere relevant for ~5+ years.
